# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been properly initialized. This typically occurs when working with asynchronous operations like data fetching, where the data might not be available immediately upon component rendering.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app in your preferred React Native environment (e.g., Expo).
4. Observe the error message in the console.  

## Solution

The solution involves using conditional rendering or the optional chaining operator to gracefully handle the uninitialized state, preventing errors. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
